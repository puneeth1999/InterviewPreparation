# Move Element to the End
### Problem Statement
An array of integers is given along with a "target element". We need to figure out a way to bring all the occurences of that particular element in the array to the end of the array.
We could solve this question in O(nlogn) time using sorting technique.

The more elegant way of doing this would be by using Two Pointer Method (Two Indices Method) though.
