# Squared Array
This question was asked in FB interview.
<br>
## Problem Statement
Given a sorted array, you need to return a list/array that contains the squares of each and every element in the given array and this resultant array must be sorted too.
## Solution
Usually, this could be solved without much of a thought in O(nlogn) time. However, what we're trying to achieve is a linear time complexity.
<br>
We can do that by using two pointer methods.
